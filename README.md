# 🍴 Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a company-standard implementation of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Zomato’s restaurant dataset.  
The analysis highlights key insights into customer preferences, restaurant trends, and business opportunities by examining:  
- Online vs offline ordering behavior  
- Popular restaurant categories  
- Cost preferences for couples  
- Rating distributions and voting trends  

The project uses **Python** and industry-standard libraries: **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Got it 👍 Since your Python script is inside:

```
zomato-data-analysis-using-python/notebooks/pythoncode/
```

Here’s the full clone and navigation code:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rasheeda-Sultana/zomato-data-analysis-using-python.git

# Move into the project folder
cd zomato-data-analysis-using-python

# Navigate to the python script inside notebooks/pythoncode
cd notebooks/pythoncode
```

At this point, you’ll be inside the folder that has your Python script(s).

👉 From here you can run your script, e.g.:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```


```

### 2. Prepare the dataset

Place the dataset file `Zomato-data-.csv` inside the `data/` folder.

### 3. Run the notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Zomato_Analysis.ipynb
```

### 4. Execute the workflow

Run all notebook cells sequentially to perform:

* Data cleaning
* Visual exploration
* Insights generation
