# 🍴 Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a company-standard implementation of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Zomato’s restaurant dataset.  
The analysis highlights key insights into customer preferences, restaurant trends, and business opportunities by examining:  
- Online vs offline ordering behavior  
- Popular restaurant categories  
- Cost preferences for couples  
- Rating distributions and voting trends  

The project uses **Python** and industry-standard libraries: **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
