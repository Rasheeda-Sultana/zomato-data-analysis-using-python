# 🍴 Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

## 📖 Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Zomato’s restaurant dataset using Python.  
The objective is to uncover meaningful insights that can support **business decisions in the food industry**, including:  
- Online vs offline ordering behavior  
- Popular restaurant categories  
- Cost preferences for couples  
- Rating distributions and voting trends  

The analysis is implemented in **Python** using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
